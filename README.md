# macaque_project


Code used for all stages of mGaP data analysis. 

1. vcfPREP - Preparation of QC'd vcf files.

2. generateRVIS - Generating a table of gene by gen RVIS scores (and other metrics) from these vcf files.

3. rvis_crucial_versus_noncrucial - Examining whether 'crucial genes' in humans are those with more
constraint (i.e. negative RVIS scores).

4. rvis_macaque_human_correlation - Corrleation between human RVIS acores and macaque RVIS scores.

5. GSEA_and_overrepresentation_analysis - Downstream analyses of ASD and other gene sets for enrichment among more evolutionarily constrained genes. 

6. predicted_damaging_analyses - analysis of frequency of damaging mutations overlapping known disease variants/genes.
